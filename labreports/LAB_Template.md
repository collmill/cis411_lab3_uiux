2. Search filters - less options, not as clear categories, cannot list degree or other job requirements

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

| Primary Actor | user|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 - ZeeMee (found by Kara-Wiegel)
2. Competitor 2 - Messiah Roomate Finder (The Nest)

## Step 3.3 Usability Test for ZeeMee the Mobile App

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  update your profile and find 3 fun questions|   |
| 2 | Find someone you would be willing to be friends with  |   |
| 3 |  Scroll through the community posts and describe a post that you find interesting or helpful |   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |  User found the app to be confusing and said that since there was no tutorial, they weren't sure what things meant or where to find new things. They were confused as to why their information was already in the app and if it was already set up. Once user found the questions, she thought they were cute and funny. |
| 2 |   |  User tried to click on what looked like a roomate request but just led to a side bar. Then she saw the people and search icon in the bottom middle and clicked on it.  User was frustrated, couldn't tell where to search. Then she found the search and filtered for class of 2026. She laughed when she saw there where only 17 matches. She was successful and found someone who she was already friends with and in her major|
| 3 |   |  User was originally confused about who was posting, if it was Messiah only or public. Scrolling through she commented on the posts on fun student activities and appreciated the reminders for important dates like FASFA. She commented that some reminders like those could have been helpful if she had known about them before. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Improvements
1. Provide clear set up for the user's profile
2. Create a tutorial/introduction that can explain to the user what the app can be used for and where to find those different things.
3. Either increase publicity for the app or remove a use from others feed (not their whole data, just their profile as a recomendation) if they have not been active for a long time. It felt as though not many people used the app and that not many still use it, so even if you reached out to someone, they would likely never see it.

Benefits
1. The main feed provides a clear view of the most recent events/posts
2. There are many filters for searching either friends or roomates that can help the user

usability test
1. I did well in covering a wide array of the app's features
2. My usability test could use a more clear and useful formatting
3. I was unsure of how exactly to conduct a test. I also had trouble determing good actions a user must take in an app like this where the user doesn't have to do many tasks, but instead would more often browse.
